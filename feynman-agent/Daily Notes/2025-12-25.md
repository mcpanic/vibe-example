### Match: Project 7: Understanding how generative UI changes the role of HCI and frontend engineering
> **Mechanism**: The tool 'Sim' replaces the traditional low-code 'palette search' pattern with a 'text-to-node' generative mechanism, providing a concrete example of how GenAI is shifting UI from static navigation to intent-based generation.

👉 **Action:** Audit Sim Studio's 'natural language to node' interaction to document exactly how intent is mapped to UI components; use this as a primary example of 'Hybrid Generative Interfaces' in the research on new interaction paradigms.

### Match: Project 4: A task-centric theory of AI impact on human skill development
> **Mechanism**: The article proposes that high-frequency AI usage can function like an addiction, where users rationalize cognitive atrophy ('destroying capability') as necessary performance enhancement ('I need it to work harder').

👉 **Action:** In your taxonomy, define a specific mode of 'Maladaptive Dependence' characterized by a divergence between User Sentiment (high confidence/justification) and Independent Competence (low skill retention). Treat high usage frequency combined with defensive rationalization as a signal of deskilling, not productivity.

### Match: 3. Project: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Contradiction**: Real-world spending data from Brex reveals that companies adopting AI coding tools (Cursor) are increasing their overall engineering budgets and hiring, directly contradicting the prevailing narrative that AI adoption is primarily for cost-cutting or replacing developers.

👉 **Action:** Anchor your talk's economic section on the 'Software Factory' paradox: use the Brex data to argue that successful AI adoption triggers a Jevons Paradox effect—where increased efficiency leads to higher consumption of code and larger teams to maximize velocity, rather than headcount reduction.
