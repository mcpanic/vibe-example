### Match: Project 3: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Mechanism**: Google's Vertex AI update shifts focus from 'creating agents' to 'Tool Governance' (approved catalogs), validating the narrative that successful adoption relies on constraining agent capabilities via organizational structure rather than open-ended prompting.

👉 **Action:** In the talk's 'Intervention' section, use the 'Approved Tool Catalog' as a concrete example of a required organizational artifact. Contrast 'Prompt Engineering' (individual skill) with 'Tool Governance' (organizational scaffolding) to explain how to scale safely.
