### Match: Project 2: Measuring productivity and skills through turn-by-turn interaction with AI coding agents
> **Mechanism**: Productivity telemetry is currently blind because it tracks generation (cheap) rather than verification (expensive); this article provides the missing metric: the presence of a 'Proof Loop' (manual or automated execution) immediately following AI code acceptance.

👉 **Action:** Instrument the IDE to detect 'Verification Events' (terminal commands, test runner execution, debugger activation) that occur within 60 seconds of an 'AI Accept' event. Create a 'Verification Ratio' metric to distinguish between developers who are 'delivering proven code' (Senior behavior) versus those dumping raw AI output (Junior/Lazy behavior).
