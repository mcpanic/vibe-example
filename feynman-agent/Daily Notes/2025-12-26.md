### Match: Project 3: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Mechanism**: The 'Farmer vs. Hunter' dichotomy provides a perfect metaphor to contrast 'Tool-Centric' adoption (Farming: linear, diligent, broad deployment) against 'Task-Centric' adoption (Hunting: identifying and attacking high-value bottlenecks).

👉 **Action:** Use the 'Farmer vs. Hunter' analogy in your talk to characterize why 'Good Student' organizations fail at AI; they treat it as a linear input (deploy tool X, get productivity Y) rather than a non-linear hunt for high-leverage 'veins' of value where they should ruthlessly focus.

### Match: Project 3: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Mechanism**: The paper offers a game-theoretic proof that standard incentive structures (like revenue sharing) break down when AI allows cheap task delegation, leading to 'excessive delegation' unless the reward model is explicitly redesigned.

👉 **Action:** In the 'Incentives' section of your talk, use this paper to argue that organizations must audit their compensation models: if they reward output volume without adjusting for AI leverage, they are financially incentivizing 'lazy delegation' rather than high-value collaboration.

### Match: Project 3: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Mechanism**: Google's pivot to 'Tool Governance' (whitelisting approved tools for agents) perfectly illustrates the shift from the 'Creation' phase to the 'Institutional' phase of AI adoption, validating the need for organizational constraints.

👉 **Action:** In your talk's section on 'Interventions,' use Google's Tool Governance as a concrete example of how organizations move from 'hype' (building anything) to 'successful collaboration' (curating the specific tools and boundaries agents are allowed to access to ensure safety and consistency).

### Match: Project 4: A task-centric theory of AI impact on human skill development
> **Mechanism**: The text contradicts the 'deskilling' narrative by providing a specific mechanism for upskilling: a designer learned copywriting by consistently reviewing AI outputs that were rigorously constrained by the founder's expert-level 'Project Instructions' and 'Project Knowledge.'

👉 **Action:** Add 'Scaffolded Review' to your skill taxonomy: define a learning mode where novices acquire skills not by doing the task from scratch, but by auditing AI outputs generated against expert-defined constraints (the 'Prompt Stock' and 'Project Knowledge').

### Match: Project 6: Building an AI-augmented personal knowledge system
> **Mechanism**: The article demonstrates an automated pipeline for converting unstructured text (meeting notes) into a structured Knowledge Graph using incremental LLM extraction, providing a technical blueprint for moving your PKM from simple storage to relational synthesis.

👉 **Action:** Examine the source code's 'incremental extraction' logic to understand how to update graph nodes without full reprocessing; apply this architecture to map your PKM readings (inputs) to your research questions (nodes) automatically.
