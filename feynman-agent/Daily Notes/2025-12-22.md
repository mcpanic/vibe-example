### Match: 3. Project: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Mechanism**: Brynjolfsson’s framework of 'General Purpose Technologies' (GPTs) and the 'Productivity J-Curve' provides the exact historical mechanism to explain why AI adoption currently feels like a failure: we are in the inevitable dip where the technology exists, but the 'complementary innovations' (organizational processes and human skills) required to unlock value haven't been invented yet.

👉 **Action:** Adopt the 'Productivity J-Curve' as the central visual and narrative framework for your talk. Use it to validate the audience's current frustrations (the dip) and pivot the definition of 'success' away from buying tools and toward inventing the 'complementary innovations' (human workflows) necessary to climb the curve.

### Match: Project 1: Turning human–AI interaction telemetry into organizational insight
> **Mechanism**: The concept of 'Agent Skills' (discrete, loaded folders of context and scripts) provides the missing 'intermediate representation' of work: tracking which skill is loaded (e.g., 'Legal Review' vs. 'Python Refactor') offers high-fidelity intent signals without needing to parse raw prompt logs.

👉 **Action:** Design your telemetry framework to treat 'Skill Activation' as the primary unit of work analysis. Instead of inferring intent from chat logs, track the explicit loading of these context folders to map organizational workflows and identify which specific processes are being successfully offloaded to AI.
