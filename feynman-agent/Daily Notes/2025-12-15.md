### Match: Project: Migrating Notion to Obsidian
> **Solution**: Instead of writing brittle regex scripts to migrate metadata, treat your Obsidian vault as a 'codebase' and use Anthropic's 'Claude Code' CLI tool to agentically refactor Notion-style properties into valid YAML frontmatter.

👉 **Action:** Install Claude Code in your vault's root directory, create a `claude.md` rule file that explicitly defines how to map specific Notion properties to Obsidian YAML, and then prompt the terminal agent to 'Iterate through all files and normalize metadata according to the rules file'.

### Match: Migrating Notion to Obsidian
> **Solution**: The text explicitly warns against manually scripting Notion migrations (contradicting your search for regex patterns) and identifies the 'Obsidian Importer Plugin' as the correct tool to resolve 'metadata rot' and preserve file structure automatically.

👉 **Action:** Abandon manual regex scripting for the Notion backlog; install the 'Obsidian Importer Plugin' to handle the bulk migration, then adapt the provided `fetch_notes.sh` script (specifically the YAML frontmatter generation block) to build your forward-looking Apple Notes capture pipeline.
