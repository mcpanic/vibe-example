### Match: Project: Migrating Notion to Obsidian
> **Solution**: Instead of writing fragile Regex scripts to fix metadata rot, use Anthropic's 'Claude Code' CLI directly inside your vault to agentically refactor text based on a natural language rule file.

👉 **Action:** Install Claude Code in your Obsidian vault root. Create a `claude.md` file that explicitly defines your desired YAML ontology (mapping Notion properties to specific Obsidian keys). Then, prompt the CLI to 'Iterate through all files in the import folder and standardise the metadata according to claude.md'.
