### Match: Project 2: Measuring productivity and skills through turn-by-turn interaction with AI coding agents
> **Mechanism**: Osmani's 'Waterfall in 15 minutes' workflow identifies a concrete, measurable behavioral signature of high-skill AI engineering: generating specifications and plans (context) before requesting code execution.

👉 **Action:** Develop a 'Time-to-First-Code' metric for your telemetry; high-skill users will likely exhibit a 'Planning Phase' (high text-input, low code-output, creation of markdown specs) at the start of a session, whereas low-skill users will likely dive immediately into code generation.

### Match: Project 3: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Mechanism**: Healthcare adoption data validates a 'Risk Gating' mechanism: AI saturates the 'administrative wrapper' of high-skill jobs (notes, billing) while remaining blocked from the 'core judgment kernel' (triage <5%), refuting binary 'replacement' narratives.

👉 **Action:**  incorporate the contrast between '66% general use' and '<5% decision support use' into your 'Tasks x Risk' framework slide to empirically demonstrate that professional AI adoption is currently shaped by risk mitigation, not just capability.

### Match: Project: Turning human–AI interaction telemetry into organizational insight
> **Mechanism**: The article proposes 'Context Graphs' composed of 'decision traces' (inputs, policy, exceptions, and overrides captured at the moment of execution) which serves as the exact 'intermediate representation' you are seeking between raw logs and abstract dashboards.

👉 **Action:** Redesign your telemetry schema to capture 'Decision Traces' rather than just interaction events. Specifically, log the state of the world (inputs available) and the specific policy or logic invoked *at the moment* a human overrides an AI agent, as this delta represents the 'organizational insight' you are trying to measure.

### Match: Project: Turning human–AI interaction telemetry into organizational insight
> **Mechanism**: Proposes shifting the unit of analysis from 'System of Record for Objects' (outcomes) to 'System of Record for Decisions' (context/rationale), utilizing AI agents to capture the ephemeral 'why' (exceptions, approvals) that usually vanishes into chat logs.

👉 **Action:** Adopt the 'Context Graph' concept as your intermediate representation: specifically instrument telemetry to capture the 'Exception,' 'Policy Applied,' and 'Human Override' moments during agent execution, rather than just the final output.

### Match: Project 5: Evaluating LLMs and AI systems based on human requirements rather than benchmarks
> **Mechanism**: The post separates the Abstract Hypothesis (A→B) from the Concrete Experiment (a→b), highlighting that as AI automates the execution (a→b), the critical human failure mode becomes the 'Translation Layer' (B→b)—defining how abstract human goals map to measurable proxies.

👉 **Action:** Adopt the 'B→b' notation to formalize your critique of benchmarks: explicitly categorize current benchmarks as 'b' (proxies) and rigorously document the 'B' (human requirement) they fail to capture, effectively treating 'metric design' as the new primary engineering challenge.
