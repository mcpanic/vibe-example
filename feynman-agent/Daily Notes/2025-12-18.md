### Match: Project 1: Turning human–AI interaction telemetry into organizational insight
> **Solution**: Anthropic's internal research provides a concrete 'intermediate representation' for telemetry: classifying user prompts against Bloom's Taxonomy to distinguish between 'answer fetching' (low-level scribe work) and 'deep inquiry' (high-level analysis).

👉 **Action:** Prototype a 'Cognitive Depth' dashboard metric that parses interaction logs and categorizes them by Bloom's Taxonomy levels; use this to show managers whether their teams are using AI to offload critical thinking (atrophy risk) or to accelerate synthesis (skill leverage).

### Match: Project 3: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Mechanism**: The shift toward "Physical AI" (integrating AI into manufacturing, logistics, and shipbuilding) provides a concrete counter-narrative to the standard "knowledge work automation" trope, illustrating how organizations can anchor AI adoption in physical/structural moats rather than just digital workflows.

👉 **Action:** Incorporate the "Physical AI" category into your talk's framework (Tasks × Skills × Risk) to illustrate high-risk, high-impact adoption scenarios. Use Korea's strategy as a case study for organizations playing to their specific strengths (e.g., heavy industry) rather than competing on generic LLM utility.

### Match: Project 6: Building an AI-augmented personal knowledge system that actually compounds insight
> **Mechanism**: Google's CC product demonstrates a 'Morning Briefing' UX pattern that shifts AI interaction from reactive querying (pull) to proactive synthesis (push), connecting disparate data sources (Drive, Gmail, Cal) into a single actionable narrative.

👉 **Action:** Adopt the 'CC' architecture for your PKM: Instead of building a chatbot you have to remember to query, script a daily agent that scans yesterday's new notes against your 12 Active Problems and emails you a 'Morning Research Briefing' containing synthesis and Feynman-style challenges.

### Match: Project 6: Building an AI-augmented personal knowledge system that actually compounds insight
> **Mechanism**: Notion's new 'Claude Skills' architecture—specifically separating agent instructions into 'scripts,' 'references,' and 'examples'—provides a proven structural mechanism for building the complex 'Feynman check' and 'synthesis' agents you require.

👉 **Action:** Download the 'notion-research-documentation' skill zip file to reverse-engineer its 8-file structure. Use this topology to build a 'Feynman Interrogator Skill' that forces the AI to check your work against specific references (your core research questions) and examples (previous successful insights), rather than generic summarization.

### Match: Project 2: Measuring productivity and skills through turn-by-turn interaction with AI coding agents
> **Mechanism**: Citation #6 ('The Productivity J-Curve') provides a theoretical mechanism explaining why telemetry data often fails to show immediate productivity gains; organizations must accumulate 'intangible capital' (new workflows) before the curve turns upward.

👉 **Action:** In your telemetry analysis, define a metric for 'Intangible Capital Accumulation'—periods where AI interaction is high but code output is low/slow. Treat this not as 'low productivity,' but as a leading indicator for the J-Curve inflection point.

### Match: Project 3: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption
> **Contradiction**: Schmidt's definition of the 'San Francisco Consensus' (TAI in 2-5 years, scaling laws hold) crystallizes the 'Replacement/Inevitability' narrative that directly threatens your 'Collaboration/Friction' thesis.

👉 **Action:** Use Schmidt's 'San Francisco Consensus' and its 3 axioms as the explicit definition of the 'Tool-Centric View' in Act 1 of your talk. This gives you a concrete adversary to dismantle when you introduce your 'Task/Organizational Friction' reality in Act 2.

### Match: Project: Turning human–AI interaction telemetry into organizational insight
> **Contradiction**: Cham argues that standard telemetry metrics (WAU) treat AI adoption like compliance, while the real signal lies in the 'lead users' (high token consumers) who are currently being punished for cost rather than studied for innovation.

👉 **Action:** Develop a 'Lead User Signal' metric for your dashboard that explicitly inverts 'High Token Cost' alerts; instead of flagging these users for budget restriction, flag them for qualitative interviews to extract the novel workflows they have developed.

### Match: Project: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Solution**: Microsoft's 2025 New Future of Work report provides a research-backed narrative framing that shifts focus from 'individual productivity' (current hype) to 'collective productivity,' directly addressing the need for a coherent, non-tool-centric story.

👉 **Action:** Download MSR-TR-2025-58 and adopt its 'Individual -> Collective' evolution as the core structural arc of your talk to distinguish it from standard 'Copilot for X' presentations.
