### Match: Project 3: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Mechanism**: The article contrasts the failure mode of AI as a 'shiny assistant' (ad-hoc prompting) with the success mode of AI as a 'System/Project' (locked instructions + deep context + shared artifacts), explicitly showing how this structure enables skill transfer (e.g., a designer performing high-level copywriting).

👉 **Action:** In your talk, frame 'The Project' (specifically Anthropic's Projects feature or custom GPTs) as the missing 'middle layer' artifact that stabilizes AI output; use the anecdote of the designer-turned-copywriter to illustrate how pre-loading context allows for 'Skill Reconfiguration' rather than just automation.

### Match: Project 1: Turning human–AI interaction telemetry into organizational insight
> **Mechanism**: The described pipeline (Unstructured Text → Incremental LLM Extraction → Knowledge Graph of 'decisions & tasks') provides the exact 'intermediate representation' needed to bridge the gap between raw telemetry logs and high-level organizational strategy.

👉 **Action:** Fork the provided repo and swap the input source from 'Google Drive Meeting Notes' to 'AI Interaction Logs'; test if this graph-extraction approach successfully clusters raw prompts into visible 'Task' and 'Decision' nodes to map organizational workflows.

### Match: Project 3: Designing a flagship talk on successful AI adoption & human–AI collaboration
> **Mechanism**: The post offers a precise conceptual framework for the 'new human role' in AI collaboration: shifting from execution to 'structural definition' (defining judgment criteria, setting automation boundaries, and designing intervention logic).

👉 **Action:** Structure the 'Human Role' section of the talk around these three specific tasks (Criteria, Boundaries, Intervention) rather than generic 'oversight.' Use the 'Structure is Speed' argument to explain that successful AI adoption requires organizations to convert 'tacit experience' into 'explicit constraints' (linters, rules, context) before agents can succeed.
